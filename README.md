# RESTHeart Cloud Starter — React

A React starter built on [`@restheart-cloud/kit-react`](https://github.com/SoftInstigate/restheart-cloud-kit/tree/main/packages/kit-react). Implements all RESTHeart Cloud auth and multi-tenancy flows out of the box — fork it, point it at your RESTHeart Cloud service, and start building your app.

Works for multi-tenant SaaS (invitations, team switcher) and simpler apps (auth only).

## What's included

- Signup, login, logout — email/password and Google/GitHub OAuth
- Email verification, password reset
- Team invitations — one page (`/invitations/accept`) branching into a new-user "set password" form (calls `PATCH /auth/activate`) or an existing-user "log in and accept" form
- Team switcher — shown only when the user belongs to more than one team
- Authenticated shell with placeholder for your app content
- Lazy-loaded routes with code splitting

## Prerequisites

1. **A RESTHeart Cloud service** — [create one at cloud.restheart.com](https://cloud.restheart.com). Use a **free** service for development, a **shared** service (or higher) for production.
2. Node.js 18+

## Setup

### 1. Fork and clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/restheart-cloud-starter-react.git
cd restheart-cloud-starter-react
npm install
```

### 2. Point to your RESTHeart Cloud service

After cloning, tell git to ignore local changes to the environment file:

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged src/environments/environment.ts
```

Then edit `src/environments/environment.ts` and set `apiUrl` to your RESTHeart Cloud service URL. Your changes will not show up in `git status`.

### 3. Start

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Structure

```
src/
  styles.css              ← design tokens + the DISPOSABLE default skin
  environments/
    environment.ts        ← apiUrl + feature flags
  routes.tsx              ← route map, feature-flag gating, lazy loading
  App.tsx                 ← fragment token capture + config screen
  main.tsx                ← RhAuthProvider + BrowserRouter
  consents-signal.ts      ← the 451 flag + the fetch interceptor that raises it
  theme hook              ← light/dark toggle, persisted (in Shell.tsx)
  ui/alert/               ← the one shared feedback component
  pages/
    shell/                ← authenticated frame: header, nav, user menu
    home/                 ← PLACEHOLDER showcase — replace with your content
    auth/                 ← login, signup, verify, forgot/reset password
    invitations/accept/   ← one page, three flows (see below)
    teams/                ← list, detail (members/invites/settings), new
    account/              ← profile + change password
```

### Route map

| Path | Guard | Shown when |
|---|---|---|
| `/auth/login` | `PublicGuard` | always |
| `/auth/signup` | `PublicGuard` | `emailRegistration \|\| oauthLogin` |
| `/auth/verify` | `PublicGuard` | `emailRegistration` |
| `/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password` | `PublicGuard` | `passwordReset` |
| `/invitations/accept` | **none** — works signed-in or out | `teamInvitations` |
| `/home`, `/teams`, `/teams/new`, `/teams/:id`, `/account` | `AuthGuard` | always |

Feature flags live in `src/environments/environment.ts` and must match your service's
**Sign-up Mgmt → Features** toggles. A flag that's off removes the route *and* the UI that
links to it.

## Customization

### The default skin is meant to be thrown away

`src/styles.css` holds two things: **design tokens** (section 1) and a **disposable
default skin** (sections 3–5). The look is deliberately a *mockup* — cohesive and
intentional, but obviously a scaffold. `@restheart-cloud/kit-react` ships no UI at all, so
the components and this one stylesheet are the only places styling lives.

Two ways forward. Pick one:

**A. Tweak the skin** — fastest, roughly an hour to something that looks like yours:

1. Change the tokens in `styles.css` section 1 — colours, type scale, spacing, radii. Every
   component reads them, so this re-themes the whole app including dark mode.
2. Adjust the skin classes in section 3 if you want different shapes.
3. Replace the shell layout in `pages/shell/`.
4. Replace `pages/home/` with your own landing content.

**B. Adopt a UI framework** — Material, shadcn/ui, Tailwind, your own:

1. Delete sections 3–5 of `styles.css` (they are marked). Keep section 1 if you want the
   tokens; drop it too if your framework brings its own.
2. Reskin the components using the swap map below.

### Swap map

Components reference a small, stable vocabulary of semantic class hooks. Restyle them, or
replace each element with your framework's component:

| Class hook | Used for | Tailwind (example) | Material (example) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.card` / `.card-header` | Section container + its title row | `rounded border p-6 mb-6` | `<Card>` |
| `.btn-primary` | The one accented action per form | `px-6 py-2 rounded bg-amber-400 font-semibold` | `<Button variant="contained">` |
| `.btn-secondary` | Quiet bordered action | `px-3 py-2 rounded border text-xs uppercase` | `<Button variant="outlined">` |
| `.btn-danger` / `.btn-danger-text` | Destructive action / inline variant | `… text-red-700 border-red-700` | `<Button variant="outlined" color="error">` |
| `.form-field` / `.form-field-sm` / `.form-row` | Label+control stack; `-sm` is narrow; `-row` lays fields side by side | `flex flex-col gap-1` / `flex gap-3` | `<TextField>` |
| `.password-field` / `.btn-toggle-password` | Password input with a Show/Hide toggle | `relative` / `absolute right-2` | `<TextField>` + end adornment |
| `.form-error` / `.field-error` | Form-level / per-field error | `rounded border border-red-300 bg-red-50 p-3` | `<FormHelperText error>` |
| `.success-msg` | Success feedback | `rounded border border-emerald-300 bg-emerald-50 p-3` | — (usually a snackbar) |
| `.muted` | Secondary/caption text | `text-sm text-gray-500` | `className="body2"` |
| `.badge` | Small status pill | `rounded-full px-2 text-xs uppercase` | `<Chip size="small">` |
| `.back-link` / `.eyebrow` | Back navigation / label above a title | `text-xs uppercase tracking-wide` | — |
| `.placeholder` / `.skeleton` | Empty-slot outline / loading block | `border border-dashed p-6` / `animate-pulse bg-gray-200` | `<LinearProgress>` |
| `.auth-page` / `.auth-card` / `.auth-links` / `.divider` | Centred auth layout | `min-h-screen grid place-items-center` / `w-90 rounded border p-8` | `<Card>` |
| `.config-page` / `.config-card` / `.config-status` / `.config-steps` | "Connect your service" screen | — | — |

Feedback is rendered through one component — `src/ui/alert/Alert.tsx` — which carries no
styles of its own, only the `.success-msg` / `.form-error` hooks plus the correct ARIA
roles. Swap that one component and every success/error message in the app follows.

Page-specific layout (`.team-row`, `.member-row`, `.feature-grid`, …) stays in the
component's own `.css` file and is not part of this contract.

## Reading your own data

Everything the starter does talks to `/auth/*`, `/token` and `/users/me` — the kit handles
those. For your application's own collections, use `auth.api`: it applies the session on the
way out, so you never attach the bearer token by hand.

```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@restheart-cloud/kit-react';
import type { ApiError } from '@restheart-cloud/kit-react';

function Notes() {
  const auth = useAuth();
  const [notes, setNotes] = useState<unknown[]>([]);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    auth.api('/notes?pagesize=10')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setNotes)
      .catch((err: ApiError) => setError(err.message));
  }, [auth.api]);

  // …
}
```

Pass a path, not a URL. Any non-2xx rejects with an `ApiError` (`{ status, message }`), so a
`403` from an ACL or a `451` from a Guards rule is something you branch on rather than parse.

A plain `fetch` to the same URL is unauthenticated, and the service answers `401` — which
reads as "logged out" rather than "you forgot the header". That is the one mistake worth
knowing about in advance.


## Consents gate

Every user must accept the current Terms of Service and Privacy Policy before they can use
the app. The rule lives on the server, as a **Guards** rule, so it applies to this app, to a
mobile client, to `curl`, and to any API integration — not just to the code below.

The client's only job is to react to a status code. Three files:

| File | Job |
|---|---|
| `src/consents-signal.ts` | Raises a flag on any `451` the API returns. Installed as a `fetch` interceptor. |
| `src/main.tsx` | Calls `installConsentsInterceptor()` before the first render. |
| `src/pages/shell/ConsentsGate.tsx` | Renders the blocking overlay while the flag is up; calls `auth.acceptConsents()` on accept. |

Nothing in the client knows which versions are current, and nothing reads `latestConsents`
— the permission's `mergeRequest` stamps the versions and the timestamp server-side. Bump
the versions in the console and every user meets the form again on their next request, with
nothing to redeploy here.

`auth.acceptConsents()` (kit ≥ 0.6.0) does the `PATCH`, then `GET /token?renew=true`, then
`GET /users/me`, then `setUser()`. The renewal is not optional: a JWT is a snapshot, and
without a fresh one the rule keeps blocking the user for the whole life of the token they
hold.

The overlay is user experience, not enforcement — remove it with the dev tools and every
request still comes back `451`.

### What makes the gate fire

The interceptor sees every `fetch` the app makes, kit calls included — but the kit only ever
talks to `/auth/*`, `/token` and `/users/me`, the paths the rule excludes, so those can never
return `451`. Only a **data** request can.

This starter has none of its own yet, so `consents-signal.ts` makes one: `probeConsents()`
does a single `GET` on `PROBE_PATH` when the gate mounts. Two things to know about it:

- **`PROBE_PATH` is `/demo` — change it** to a collection your service actually has. The
  server setup below creates one.
- **It attaches the bearer token itself.** `rhAuthInterceptor` only clears the session on a
  `401`; it does not authenticate outgoing requests. An unauthenticated probe gets `401`,
  not `451`, and the gate stays down.

Once your app reads data on its first screen, delete the probe — any real request raises the
flag just as well.

### Server setup (required)

Enable the **Guards** plugin from *Service → Guards*, then create four documents in the
console. Full walkthrough: [Gating a React app on consents](https://cloud.restheart.com/blog)
and the [Guards documentation](https://restheart.org/docs/cloud/guards#_example_gating_on_consents).

0. **A collection to read**, so there is a request the rule can block:
   `PUT /demo`, then `POST /demo` with `[{"n": 1}, {"n": 2}, {"n": 3}]`.
1. **A schema** (`userConsentsSchema`) allowing `latestConsents` and `consents` on the user
   document — with neither in `required`, since registration does not write them.
2. **A permission** on `PATCH /users/{userId}`, scoped with `bson-request-whitelist(consents)`
   and carrying the `mergeRequest` that stamps the versions. Without it the acceptance is a
   `403` and the user is locked out for good.
3. **Two JWT claims**: `latestConsents/tos` *and* `latestConsents/pp`. If either is missing,
   the rule blocks every token-authenticated user permanently.
4. **The rule**, blocking with `451` — and excluding `/auth`, `/token`, `/users/me` and the
   acceptance `PATCH` itself, which are the requests a blocked user needs in order to stop
   being blocked.

Until those exist nothing ever returns `451`, the flag stays down, and the overlay never
renders.
